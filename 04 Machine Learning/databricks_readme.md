Click **Import** to bring up a form for importing a file. Select radio button **URL** and paste in the URL you have copied above. Press import and there you go, happy coding!

The code in files decision_trees.dbc and kmeans.dbc are modified versions of code files provided by Paul Rodriguez, Ph.D. of San Diego Supercomputer Center.

The aim was to modify the code to make it run in Databricks Community Edition cloud service and learn the concepts while providing the same experience to future students as well.

I do not claim any rights for this code; I am just a student passing by and leaving some goodies for the next students seeking knowledge.
