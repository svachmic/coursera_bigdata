## Acknowledgements

The code in file decision_trees.dbc is a modified version of code files provided by Paul Rodriguez, Ph.D. of San Diego Supercomputer Center.

The aim was to modify the code to make it run in Databricks Community Edition cloud service and learn the concepts while providing the same experience to future students as well.

I do not claim any rights for this code; I am just a student passing by and leaving some goodies for the next students seeking knowledge.
